//! UTXO locking mechanism for transaction construction.
//!
//! This module provides functionality to temporarily lock UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs)
//! during transaction construction, preventing double-spending scenarios where the same
//! outputs might be selected for multiple concurrent transactions.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! When creating a transaction, the wallet must:
//! 1. Select appropriate UTXOs to cover the transaction amount plus fees
//! 2. Lock those UTXOs to prevent other transactions from using them
//! 3. Either complete the transaction (consuming the UTXOs) or release the lock on failure
//!
//! The [`FundLocker`] handles steps 1 and 2, with automatic expiration to handle step 3
//! in case of failures or timeouts.
//!
//! # Idempotency
//!
//! Lock operations support idempotency keys, allowing clients to safely retry requests
//! without accidentally locking additional funds. If a lock request with the same
//! idempotency key already exists, the original result is returned.
//!
//! A key alone is not enough to authorise that short-circuit. Every caller must
//! supply an [`IdempotencyBinding`], which ties the key to the operation and the
//! exact request that created the lock; a replay that does not match is rejected
//! as an [`IdempotencyConflict`] instead of being handed the reservation. See
//! [`crate::transactions::idempotency`] for what that prevents.
